### **5.4 Get Consecutive Study Days**

- **URL Parameters**:
  - id: ID of the deck

**Success Response (200 OK):**

Example for an **active streak**:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "timestamp": "2025-11-24T10:30:00.000Z",
  "message": "Get consecutive study days",
  "data": {
    "consecutiveDays": 7,
    "streakStartDate": "2025-11-17T00:00:00.000Z",
    "lastStudyDate": "2025-11-24T00:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "path": "/api/study/consecutive-days/3"
}
```

Example for a **broken streak** (not studied today or yesterday):

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "timestamp": "2025-11-24T10:30:00.000Z",
  "message": "Get consecutive study days",
  "data": {
    "consecutiveDays": 0,
    "streakStartDate": null,
    "lastStudyDate": "2025-11-20T00:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "path": "/api/study/consecutive-days/3"
}
```

Example for a **deck with no study history**:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "timestamp": "2025-11-24T10:30:00.000Z",
  "message": "Get consecutive study days",
  "data": {
    "consecutiveDays": 0,
    "streakStartDate": null,
    "lastStudyDate": null
  },
  "path": "/api/study/consecutive-days/3"
}
```

**Response Field Descriptions:**

- consecutiveDays (number): The number of consecutive days the deck has been studied. Returns 0 if:
  - The deck has never been studied
  - More than one day has passed since the last study session (streak broken)
- streakStartDate (string | null): ISO 8601 timestamp of when the current streak started (normalized to start of day in UTC). null if there is no active streak.
- lastStudyDate (string | null): ISO 8601 timestamp of the most recent study session (normalized to start of day in UTC). null if the deck has never been studied.

**How Consecutive Days Are Calculated:**

1. All reviews for cards in the deck are collected
2. Review dates are normalized to the start of the day (UTC) and deduplicated \- multiple reviews on the same day count as one study day
3. The streak is considered active if the last study date is today or yesterday
4. Starting from the most recent study date, consecutive days are counted backward
5. The streak breaks when there's a gap of more than one day between study sessions

**Notes:**

- A "study day" is defined by having at least one card review submitted on that day
- Multiple reviews on the same day count as a single study day
- The streak continues if you study either today or yesterday (1-day gap is allowed to account for timezone differences and late-night studying)
- All dates are normalized to UTC for consistency
- An empty deck (no cards) or a deck with cards but no reviews will return consecutiveDays: 0

### **5.5 Start Cram Session (Practice Mode)**

Get cards for practice without affecting their scheduling (Cram Mode). This allows users to review cards immediately, regardless of their due date.

- **URL**: /study/cram/:deckId
- **Method**: GET
- **Auth Required**: Yes
- **URL Parameters**:
  - deckId: ID of the deck
- **Query Parameters**:
  - limit: (Optional) Number of cards to fetch (default: 50)

**Success Response (200 OK):**

```json
{
  "message": "Cram session started",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "deckId": 3,
      "front": "What is 3+3?",
      "back": "6",
      "createdAt": "2025-11-23T13:44:29.060Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-11-23T13:44:29.091Z",
      "tags": "math,basics",
      "status": "review",
      "nextReviewDate": "2025-12-01T10:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

**Notes:**

- Cards are selected randomly from the deck.
- Reviews submitted during a cram session should **NOT** be sent to the `/study/review` endpoint if you want to avoid updating the card's schedule.
- This mode is purely for extra practice.

### **5.6 Submit Cram Review**

Submit reviews for cram sessions. These reviews are recorded to count towards study streaks but do **NOT** update the card's SRS schedule (interval, ease factor, etc.).

- **URL**: /study/cram/review
- **Method**: POST
- **Auth Required**: Yes

**Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "CardReviews": [
    {
      "cardId": 1,
      "quality": "Good"
    }
  ],
  "reviewedAt": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Success Response (201 Created):**

```json
{
  "statusCode": 201,
  "timestamp": "2025-11-23T13:44:29.122Z",
  "message": "Submitting cram review",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 105,
      "cardId": 1,
      "repetitions": 0,
      "interval": 1,
      "eFactor": 2.5,
      "nextReviewDate": "2023-10-28T10:00:00.000Z",
      "reviewedAt": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z",
      "quality": "Good",
      "previousStatus": "review",
      "newStatus": "review"
    }
  ],
  "path": "/api/study/cram/review"
}
```

**Notes:**

- Use this endpoint to log progress during cram sessions.
- It ensures that cramming contributes to the user's daily study streak.
- The `previousStatus` and `newStatus` will be identical, and `interval` will remain unchanged.
